# Agile Fundamentals

- *Agile was formally launched in 2001, when 17 technologists drafted the **Agile Manifesto**.*

- `Adaptiveness, Response to Change`

- `Manifesto for Agile Software Development`
    - **`We are uncovering bettwe ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.`**

    - **`**4 VALUES of Agile Manifesto`**
        - *`Individuals nad interactions over processes and tools`*
        - *`Working software over comprehensive documentation`*
        - *`Customers colloboration over contract negotiation`*
        - *`Responding to change over following a plan`*

- `Principles behind the Agile Mainfesto`

    - **Customer Satisfaction**
    - **Welcome Change**
    - **Deliver Frequently**
    - **Work Together**
    - **Motivated Team**
    - **Face to Face**
    - **Working Software**
    - **Constant Pace**
    - **Technical Excellence**
    - **Simplicity**
    - **Self Organization**
    - **Reflect and Adjust**

- *Agile as a concept is finally coming of age as a **philosophy** and **way of thinking** in lieu of being seen as mere project management methodology.*

    - So what is this **Way of Thinking**?

        - ***EMPIRICISM*** 
            - By defination -> The theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived form the senses.
            - Decision based on observation.

        - `Empiricism` is the foundation of `Scrum`.(agile framework)

            - Three pillar of Scrum 
                - **Transparency**
                    - *`presenting the facts as is`*
                - **Inspect**
                    - *`can be done for your product,processes,people & improvement`*
                - **Adapt**
                    - *`adopting the change based on the inspection`*

            - `Scrum is Designed around these pillar`, like being transparent to each other and inspect what you did yesterday and what you gonna do today and adpat your plan accordingly.


        - `Extreme Programming` is also align with `EMPIRICISM`.(agile framework)
            - A core tenet of `Extreme Programming`

                - **Embrace Change**
                    - `acknowledge the customers requirement change`


- **About WaterFall Model**

    - has never worked in `large software development`.
    - waterfall principles are still ingrained in they way we work today.

- **Scrum-Glossary**

    - *Scrum Master*
        - `Role` within a `Scrum Team` accountable for `guiding`, `coaching`, `teaching` and `assisting` a Scrum Team and its environments in a `proper understanding and use of Scrum`.

    - *Product Owner*
        - `Role` in Scrum accountable for `maximizing the value` of a `product`,primarily by incrementally managing and expressing business and functional expectations for a product to the `Developers`

    - *Developer/DevTeam*
        - `Any memeber` of a `Scrum Team`, that is committed to `creating` any aspect of a `usable Increment` each Sprint `regardless` of `technical`, `functional` or `other speciality`.


    - *Sprint Planning*
        - `Scrum Event` that is time-boxed to `8 hours`, or less, `to start` a `Sprint`.
        - It serves for the Scrum Team to inspect the work from the `Product Backlog` that's most valuable to be done next and design that work into Sprint backlog.

    - *Sprint*
        - `Scrum Event` that is time-boxed to `one month or less`, that serves as` container` for the other `Scrum events` and `activites`.
        - Sprints are done consecutively, without intermediate gaps.

    - *Product Backlog*
        - A `Scrum Artifact` that consists of an `ordered list of the work` to be `done` in order to `create`,`maintain` and `sustain`a product.
        - `Managed `by the `Product Owner`.

    - *Sprint Backlog*
        - A `Scrum Artifact` that provides an overview of the developement work to realize a Spirint's goal,typically a forecast of functionality and the work needed to deliver that functionality.
        - `a subset of the product backlog and lists the work items to complete in one specific sprint`
        - `Managed` by the Developers.    

    - *Daily Scrum*
        - A `Scrum Event` that is a `15-minute` time-boxed event held `each day` for the `Developers`.
        - At it, the Developers plan work for the next `24hours`.
        - This `optimizes` team collaboration and performance by `inspecting` the work since the `last Daily Scrum` and `forecasting upcoming` Sprint work.

    - *Increment*
        - A `Scrum Artifact` that defines the `complete` and `valuable` work produced by the Developers during a `Sprint`.
        - `The sum of all Increments froms a product.`

    - *Review*
        - A `Scrum Event` that is set to a time-boxed of `4 hours` or less, to `conclude the developement work` of a Sprint.
        - It serves for the `Scrum Team` and the `stakeholders` to `inspect ` the Increment of `product` resulting from the Sprint.
    
    - *Retrospective*
        - A `Scrum Event` that is set to a time-box of `3 hour` or less, to `end a Sprint`. 
        - It serves for the `Scrum Team` to `inspect` the `past Sprint` and `plan` for `improvements` to be enacted during `future Sprints`.

    - *Stakeholder*
        - A person `external` to the `Scrum Team` with a specific interset in and knowledge of a product that is required for incremental discovery.
        - `Represented` by the `Product Owner` and `actively engaged` with the `Scrum Team` at `Sprint Review`.

    - *Agile Scrum Artifacts*
        - Agile scrum artifacts are `information` that a `Scrum Team` and `Stakeholders` use to `detail the product being developed`,`actions to produce it`, and `the actions performed during the project`.
        - These artifacts provide metadata points that give insight into the performance of a sprint.
            - `Product Backlog`
            - `Sprint Backlog`
            - `Increment`

    - *Agile Scrum Events*
        - They provide structure and give an opportunity to inspect and adapt the development process with each software iteration.

            - `Sprint Planning`
            - `Sprint`
            - `Daily Scrum`
            - `Sprint Review`
            - `Sprint Retrospective`
